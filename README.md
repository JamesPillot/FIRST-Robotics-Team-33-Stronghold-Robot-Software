# FIRST-Robotics-Team-33-Stronghold-Robot-Software
Led our controls team in software development using National Instrument's Labview for the machine. In this project I got my first hands on experience with vision processing and target identification. As seen on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-pillot-iv-7a7922ba/

A huge thanks goes out to the Killerbees Organization and to Cory Ness and Andrew Palardy for their assistance in vision processing and creating autonomous scripts.
